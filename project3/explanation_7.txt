We were asked to implement the add_handler and lookup methods of our Router class which wraps the RouteTrie and RouteTrieNode classes. 

add_handler:
In this method, we add a full to our RouteTrie with an associated handler. 
To add a path and handler to the RouteTrie, we first split up the full path into path pieces with "/" as the splitting points.
Then we add in each path piece one at a time and give each a RouteTrieNode object. Given that N is the number of path pieces we have:
Time: O(N), Space: O(N) for each RouteTrie and another O(N) to hold the array of path pieces. Total space O(N)

lookup:
In the lookup method, we first break up the full path into path pieces. Then we iterate through each path piece and check if it is in the RouteTrieNode children. 
If path is not there, we return None. If it is there, we keep going until we go through all path pieces. Given N is the number of path pieces from the full path,
Time: O(N), Space: O(N). Only a variable is used to keep track of the current RouteTrieNode while searching and O(N) needed to hold the array of path pieces.
