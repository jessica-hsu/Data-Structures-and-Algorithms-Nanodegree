The problem statement said that the expected time complexity is O(logN). This suggests that some form binary search. 
The square root of any number, x, is always between 1 and x. From here we will use binary search to try to find the integer, n, so that 
when n*n we get a product that will either be equal to x or close enough.
Only data structure used are constants. They are used to store the high, low, target, and squared values.

Time complexity for binary search is O(logN) and space complexity is O(1).
